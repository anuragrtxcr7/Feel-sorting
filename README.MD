# Overview of the project: -

- In this Project I made and deployed a website which helps us understand and visualize various Sorting Algorithms with vibrant colors and animated swap operations.
- It includes Time Variation slider that lets us feel the Time complexity of various sorting algorithms and their optimisation.
- In this project I used the knowledge of Data-Structures and Algorithms to code various Sort Algorithms in JavaScript along with the concepts of Document Object Model and asynchrounous functions to make my project function with time.


# Sorting Algorithms

- The Sorting Algorithms included are:-

    1. Bubble Sort
    2. Selection Sort
    3. Insertion Sort
    4. Quick Sort
    5. Merge Sort



# Page Load Time

- Page load time measures how long it takes for the contents of a website to show up in the user’s browser. The loading process of a website will consist of multiple milestones, for example starting to show text or displaying a hero image.

- For this website I measured the Page Load time after deploying this website and measured its data from Google’s Page speed insights.
- My First Contentful and largest Contentful Paint came out to be 1.2s
- My Total Blocking time was 0 sec
- My speed index was 1.3 sec

- The page load time of website depends on the Server Response time, download Sizes and Rendering Times.
